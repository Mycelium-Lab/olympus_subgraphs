  <h1>Olympus Monitoring Subgraphs</h1>
</div>

Subgraphs are used to track blockchain data. We thematically split blockchain data tracking via The Graph into an array of subgraphs (all of them are mentioned below) so as to be more efficient in terms of getting new data and be easier to work with.

Subgraphs in this repository are split into 6 groups/folders:
<ul>
<li>main (staking, bonds, rebases)</li>
<li>sushiswap-ohm (ohm price)</li>
<li>treasury (deposits, withdrawals, etc.)</li>
<li>treasury_tokens (treasury balance in various "reserve" tokens)</li>
<li>balances (wallets, transfer, mints, supply, etc.)</li>
<li>sohm (sOHM index, sOHM balances)</li>
</ul>
